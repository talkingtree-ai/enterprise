# Talking Tree Enterprise 

Thank you for being a customer of Talking Tree. These docs will help you set up an on-prem deployment of our product.

## Getting Started

Get started by **Determining the type of enterprise setup you would like**.


### On Prem Deployment
Talking Tree ships its on-prem deployment via a set of Docker containers. You can look at the `examples` folder for ways you can deploy it. You can deploy it on one machine just using a Docker Compose file, or if you need to scale it out, you can use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. Our white glove service is available to help you set up the service on your infrastructure, as well as provide maintenance and troubleshooting.

For more information and detailed documentation, please refer to the on-prem section. 


### Talking Tree Hosted
TalkingTree is capable of hosting an enterprise deployment with flexibility. We can assist in setting up a subdomain, such as `[your_company].talkingtree.app`, and integrate it with your OIDC SSO. Alternatively, we can utilize any domain or subdomain you control. Our white glove service is available to help configure your domain records and to provide other support.
